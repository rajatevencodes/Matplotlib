Data visualization libraries turn your data into graphics, helping you find unexpected insights. As statistician John Tukey said, **"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see."**

Two fundamental libraries for this in Python are Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#### Matplotlib ðŸŽ¨

**Matplotlib** is the foundational plotting library in Python, designed to provide extensive control over every aspect of a figure. It is a powerful tool capable of creating a huge variety of static, animated, and interactive charts.

Everything in Matplotlib revolves around the **`Figure`** (the main window or canvas) and the **`Axes`** (the individual plot or chart) objects.

#### Seaborn âœ¨

**Seaborn** is a high-level data visualization library **built on top of Matplotlib**. It helps you create more attractive and statistically informative plots with less code.

Everything in Seaborn is designed to work seamlessly with Pandas **`DataFrames`**, making it incredibly intuitive to explore and understand your data visually.
